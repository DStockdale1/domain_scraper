LAST CHANCE Obviously a lot is being said in the media at the moment and our sincere wishes go out to anyone who has lost their jobs or in a position that may. We have been speaking to many buyers who are looking at putting their property search on hold until after the epidemic has finished. I cannot stress how wrong this idea is. We have the very real possibility that over the next few Saturdays we may go into some form of lock down and unable to show homes and as you have probably seen the number of new properties coming to the market has slowed considerably. Banks will begin to tighten on lending and your borrowing capacity may/will drop. If you see a home with our office or another agency and you like it... buy it. Why would you wait for the market to rebound and compete against the strong numbers you have seen over the last 6 months? Don\'t believe us? We are Real Estate agents? I ask you to speak to any family or friends that were looking to purchase property pre-election. All the media spoke about was the potential crash our market would face post-election. The market had in fact bounced back to prices last seen at the property peak. Don\'t make the same mistake they did and jump on whilst you are in the box seat as you can see properties are definitely still selling and opportunities to be had.  All the best to everyone and remember your social distancing.
