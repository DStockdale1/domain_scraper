Set on the high side of one of Avalon\'s most desirable streets, this Bellevue Avenue home is just footsteps from the beach and village shops. It reminds us of all the things that we enjoyed as kids! It also encapsulates all that makes the Avalon lifestyle so special. For a start, the house sits on a huge, sunny, 1213sqm block, under a big blue sky, with magnificent trees to climb, sunny stone terrace areas to gather on, wide lawns to roll on and garden beds to grow. If you\'re looking for a family home with heart and soul, grace and charmthis is surely it!  Long held by an Avalon family with deep roots in the area, this is a special property reminiscent of an English farmhouse. Whisper quiet, yet not at all remote...it\'s set right in the heart of the village, just a street behind the shops! We think the house itself is particularly enticing, capturing an (almost) unsullied 1940s vibe; homely and interesting with a huge stone fireplace in the lounge, wonderful hardwood floors (in pristine condition) beneath the carpet, and character doors and windows throughout.  Practical in its layout: The home has four large bedrooms upstairs along with the family bathroom. There\'s a fifth bedroom downstairs with an ensuite. The formal lounge and dining room opens to a large family room that then opens onto a wide sunny stone terrace. Everything flows and is super comfortable and in good working condition, yet ripe for an update.  Of course, it helps that this home has been so lovingly cared for by the same owners over some 50+ years. Its wonderful pristine state is testament to their appreciation of the house, the garden and their long and stable family life.  Close to everything, this one\'s a winner - and better in real life than online - so call us to make a time to view! Virtual Tour Available",32,18,29,21,58,90,10,67,33,40 to 59,-1,"9,906"
