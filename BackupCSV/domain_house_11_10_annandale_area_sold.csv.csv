The modest frontage of the 1890s brick and tile, semi-detached terrace, located on leafy Rose Street in the suburb of Annandale gives few clues to the modernist interior within. Occupying a corner block, architect Don Gazzard, a distinguished figure of the Australian architectural community, took best advantage of the slope and northerly orientation of the site, subverting the logic of the terrace and turning it 180 degrees. The house enjoys a perfect NNE (22) aspect to main living and courtyard. Entry is to the side off Nelson Street, between a Kevlar-clad garage and the existing cottage and is framed by a composition of brightly coloured walls and a signature glass block wall. Ascending, past the reflection pool at eye level, into the courtyard the architecture doesn\'t so much unfold as hit you squarely between the eyes as one enters the unexpected 4.7m height of the main living space, that incorporates sitting, dining and kitchen with mezzanine above.  The experience is in direct contrast to that of a Victorian cottage. The architect has not only reinvented the site but demonstrates that heritage can be respected and made relevant for living today.  There are very small number of new builds in the locale that can compete with the spatial qualities of One Rose. It is this very use of space in the hands of an architects architect that shows us quite how illogical it is to accept the confined spaces of yesteryear.
