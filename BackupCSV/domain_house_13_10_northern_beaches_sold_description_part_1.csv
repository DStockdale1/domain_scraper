Doors slide from the living room to a covered terrace overlooking the garden. At the other end of the house are 2 large bedrooms, both with built-in robes, sharing a neat modern bathroom. The master has doors opening directly back to the covered terrace. Below, there\'s a single stone garage with a high ceiling and garage door. still under the house and behind the parking area, there\'s a huge storage area, that could double as a cellar - conditions are perfect for it.  Outside, there are a couple of level areas which, with a bit of TLC, could be lush level lawns, and a mass of planting that could definitely benefit from a few green thumbs, and some structure.  Private, yet moments from Whale Beach one way and Avalon Village the other - and with local shops in between - you\'re close to it all, yet away from the bustle. There\'s a bus stop right next door.

The substantial home has been updated regularly and includes 4 bedrooms and a large bedroom sized study.

The peace and quiet can really only be fully appreciated once you are there. With only a gentle slope to the street front this 1492sqm block is what one would call a \'double block\', and likely is large enough (STCA), to sub divide. One thing is for sure, blocks like this aren\'t often available and one would generally have to travel well out of the city area to get another in this price range. Located only 2  kilometres to the beach and less to go for a paddle in Narrabeen Lakes, or visit the many parks and larger shopping centres; really it\'s only about a five to ten minute drive for everything a local needs. The shopping village is even a walk away, as is the Express bus directly into town. Elanora also enjoys being near the junction of three major linking roads so you have access to everywhere without having to be right on top of it.
