A rare find on a ""bowling green block"".  Originally purchased in 1951 for the princely sum of 250 pounds as vacant land, and part of a land grant acquisition. Never has this property been presented for sale, having been occupied by it\'s original owners and builders. This ""rock solid"" home was built with the intention of being a 2-storey so, the foundations are double brick into the bedrock. The family worked together to build a beautiful family home, often working late into the evenings after their day jobs , moving bricks and sand etc. to save costs where subcontractors had to be used. A modest but functional home was built for themselves and their 2 children, who are now looking to pass on a piece of their family history to a new family. The interior finishes were all done by the husband having studied woodwork at school and higher education. You only have to look inside the wardrobes to see the work of a craftsman for yourself. A double brick home that will be cool in summer and hold the warmth in winter. Beautiful cypress pine floors that were covered have been restored to their original glory. The home was rewired some years ago and bathroom and laundry re vamped. The enormous backyard is yours to utilise an any way you can envisage. Centrally located to rail and bus transport, University and schools, shopping meccas and countless leisure pursuits. What better place to invest in your future dreams? With a substantial footprint would allow a second storey to be added to this home giving you views for kilometres as well as ample space for a growing family.
