An ingenious floorplan allows for privacy and space across all three of the home\'s floors and, found throughout, is a superb level of finish.  From the grand street presence of the home, to the intricate detail of the fixtures and fittings, No. 11 is uncompromising in its stately offerings. Past the stylish security fencing and over the manicured lawns, you\'re greeted on entry by a striking staircase with timber accents. These accents play a large role in the property\'s overall design and can be seen in many, varied elements throughout the home - from the beautiful hardwood floors to the character buttressing. Offset the entry, still on the ground floor, is the spacious, extra-large, master bedroom.  Which comes complete with an ensuite, inclusive of dual basins and a walk-in wardrobe.  The main walkway then flows through to an enormous combined living, dining and kitchen area, which enjoys a leafy outlook. This interior space is warmed by a large fireplace and the kitchen is equipped with stylish, first-class appliances. There is also a walk-in pantry for both convenience and storage and, neatly tucked away, behind the kitchen, is a multi-purpose storage room, which serves as the command centre for the home\'s intelligent security systems. Following the flow upstairs, you\'ll find a rumpus area of incredibly generous proportions and three bedrooms, each with their own built-in wardrobes. This space is serviced by a full-sized bathroom and, thanks to its seclusion, could easily serve as a theatre room, second living area or a hide-away for the kids. Access to the lower level is given via a staircase in the corner of the kitchen and dining area. And as the stairs spiral down, glass paneling along the walls give view through to one of the home\'s most unique features - an extra-large wine cellar. Easily the size of most standard bedrooms, the cellar offers wall-to-wall storage and, again, is beautifully highlighted by the home\'s ever-present, signature timber accents. This downstairs space, was designed with privacy in mind and, for those in need of a home with the space for extended living arrangements, could comfortably suit the parents, grandparents or in-laws. It has a bedroom, only fractionally smaller than the master suite, its own walk-in wardrobe, a full bathroom, a living and dining area with yet another gas fireplace and, perhaps most important of all, a bar.  And for those who enjoy the outdoors or have a flare for entertaining, both the main living and dining area and the lower level space, open up onto their own enclosed undercover areas.  Both of which overlook the distant trees and manicured grounds. Truly a unique property with a versatile floorplan, idyllic location and incredible offerings. Summary of features include:  Brand new ultra-modern home with a luxurious level of finish throughout  Unique tri-level design with living areas across all three floors  5 extra spacious bedrooms  Enormous central living and dining area with a wood fireplace  Wine cellar and built-in bar  Two covered outdoor entertaining areas  Manicured grounds with a leafy rear outlook Disclaimer: We have obtained all information herein from sources we believe to be reliable; however, we cannot guarantee its accuracy.
