The house, which was built in 2005, features a modernist modular design taking advantage of the views to forest areas to the southeast, and easterly views to Point Perpendicular at Jervis Bay. The house construction makes use of traditional materials with roof forms of a contemporary manner providing the connection to traditional imagery but allowing for a more comfortable and contemporary lifestyle. It is orientated so that the living and master bedroom areas look out to the bay and forest views, and that the house appears as a collection of buildings connected by verandahs which visually references the idea of a traditional cluster of farm buildings. The house was designed by Bishop + Hitchcock Architects in Nowra. The home is currently configured as a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom with a double garage but during the design of the home, a future planned option was allowed for splitting the oversized 3rd bedroom in half to create a 4th bedroom. The surrounding grounds around the home feature a tapestry of colour thanks to cleaver planting of mature gardens, a large kitchen garden with raised garden beds and fruiting citrus trees. An oversized machinery shed is also within reach of the house, so you can easily access your tractor or quad bike and workshop. Features at a glance: * 40 hectares / 100 acres * Architecturally designed home featuring 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and double lock up garage * Elevated position with views to Jervis Bay * Small creek on one of the boundaries * Tank water and septic system * 6 paddocks with shade trees * Large machinery shed",,,,,[,100,0,0,100,60+,-1,180
