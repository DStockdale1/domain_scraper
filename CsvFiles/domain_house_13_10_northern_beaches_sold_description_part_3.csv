WHAT THE OWNER\'S HAVE LOVED ABOUT THEIR HOME &amp; LOCATION We purchased our home nearly 20 years ago and it has been a much-loved home for 5 children as teenagers and then going into their twenties. In 2006 we added a new double storey addition to accommodate our growing family There was always competition amongst them about who would live in the large downstairs studio with its ensuite, deck and own entrance. It was also occasionally a perfect space to offer overseas visitors.  We have loved gathering around the north-facing patio for long lunches and dinners on balmy summer evenings, with the wide bifold doors opening the living and dining rooms to the garden. A memorable setting for family gatherings, Christmas and parties.  The upstairs spacious master bedroom with its cathedral ceilings and balcony has provided a haven for us.  North Curl Curl has a kind of holiday feel. Our favourite swimming spots are the rock pools at both ends of Curly Beach. Being out there amongst the cliffs and the waves and the gulls, the big city all around you seems far away. The restaurants and cafes of Dee Why and Manly are a short drive away. The E76 and E77 buses to the city stop outside the door, and other buses are a short walk down the road. North Curl Curl Public School is an easy walk, and there are several other schools nearby and Warringah Mall is a 10 minute drive away. We have had so many happy memories here however it has now come the time in our lives for us to downsize.  It will be sad to leave however we know the new owners will love this home and location just as much as we have.
