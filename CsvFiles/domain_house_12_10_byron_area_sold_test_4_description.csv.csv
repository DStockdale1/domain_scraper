Designed for self-sufficiency, yet perfect for entertaining.  The property is located at the end of Tallowood Road - a secluded, no-through road with very little traffic. A tarred sealed drive sweeps into the property\'s tropical gardens, delivering you to the resort-style home.  Simple and tasteful in its design, the home features two separate zones - the main home which features an open-plan design of kitchen, dining, living, bedrooms and loft, and a second zone which features a large studio-style bedroom retreat which can be used as a permanent parent\'s retreat or as guest accommodation. The picture is completed with wrap-around verandahs, decks and outdoor entertaining areas with views of Coorabell Valley\'s rolling green hills in the distance.  The northern aspect of the house and the orientation of living spaces north helps to ensure cool summers and warm winters, as well as protection from southerly storms. Designed to make the most of the spectacular natural surrounds, the home features a full-size tennis court and saltwater swimming pool, oriented to take the best advantage of the sun and the seasons (the current owners swim from September to June). There is an abundance of wildlife including koalas, echidnas, bandicoots, wallabies, platypus in the creek, as well as a huge variety of birds.  Once a thriving herb farm, the fenced property slopes gently down to the creek (the property boundary runs along Coorabell Creek) and features a natural spring which feeds the property\'s dam. Importantly, there are approximately 40,000 litres of water storage. There is also a large utilitarian shed with plenty of space for tools and equipment. A gardener\'s delight, the property features orchard trees such as mangoes, limes, lemons, oranges, mandarin, grapefruit, coffee, and macadamia nuts, as well as a veggie garden, with four sun-drenched and water supplied garden beds. The exceptional horse paddocks could easily be converted for commercial crops. Centrally located between the towns of Byron, Bangalow, Federal and Mullumbimby, the home is located within the Coorabell Public School zone, a wonderful small primary school which is known as one of the best in NSW. The current owners say the sale is a reluctant one. ""We love this home, and have created the most wonderful memories here,"" says Fay. ""As soon as I saw it, I fell in love with it. I loved its position and the privacy it offered.  I love how well it blends with its surrounds. Walking through the grounds was always a joy, and every now and then we would be visited by a wallaby or echidna, while every year a koala has a little sojourn to one of the gum trees at the front of the house. ""The decks have always offered a place of peace from where I could enjoy the view and refer to my bird book with regards to the wonderful array of native birds that would visit the trees nearby.  ""The northern deck - sundrenched in winter and shaded in summer - is our main living space. In summer, the kids are swimming happily in the pool, with horses in the adjoining paddock, and magpies singing in the shading Poinciana tree - it\'s pure bliss.  ""The vegetable garden has supplied up to 50% of our grocery needs at times, and when we have chickens in the chicken coop, we have an abundant supply of eggs daily. ""It really has been very difficult for me to say goodbye to my little piece of paradise.""

Clover Hill House is a gracious weatherboard home, built in the early 1920\'s in the \'Art Nouveau\' style. The grand home was built for W H Rankin, one of the Pioneer settlers in the district, by local builder A E Beckinsale. The dairy farming land had previously been owned by some other familiar names including William Barby and T Robinson. The elegant home features 12ft ceilings with beautiful plaster ceiling roses, double-hung timber sash and bay windows and French doors throughout. In its original build it had open verandahs on three sides however, these have been enclosed, increasing the internal floor plan dramatically. The room sizes are extremely generous with formal living and dining areas at the front of the home. There are multiple bedrooms and an area at the rear of the home that was used as a self-contained granny flat. This property would be lovely as a family home or perfect as a bed and breakfast establishment/guesthouse. Once presiding over the entire Clover Hill, the surrounding land was sub-divided to form the Clover Hill estate, leaving the home on a generous 2379sqm allotment. There is a reserve to the front of the home which allows views all the way up the main street of Bangalow and beyond to the rolling hills Bangalow is famous for.  Clover Hill House was owned by the late Alice Holm who lived in the home for over 40 years up until her 95th year. Alice was well known and loved in Bangalow and in her more active years, she loved walking into the village and would chat with her new neighbours along the way. Alice was very generous and loved gardening and shared cuttings from her own garden with many of her neighbours in Clover Hill.

Set on 56 pristine acres, Coorabella has a magical feel to it - that rare quality that comes from the land. A stream runs through the property (home to an abundance of wildlife including the resident platypus) with frontage to the Wilson River and a magical, deep swimming hole as well as a private waterfall. The property was purchased 25 years ago by designer Giovanni D\'Ercole, founder of the LOVE &amp; HATRED luxury jewellery brand. While nature has taken care of the surrounds, Giovanni\'s skilled eye and attention to detail have transformed the stunning Queenslander into a truly unique estate. With four bedrooms, four bathrooms, studies and a library, Coorabella offers spectacular views from every room, including each of the luxuriously spacious bedrooms. The home is the perfect balance of the classic and the contemporary, weaving the two effortlessly to create the best of both worlds. Features such as 14ft towering ceilings with original pressed-tin finishes, textured leadlight window panels, claw-footed bath, and open fire place pay homage to the property\'s heritage. Coorabella is sensitively modernized with features such as ducted reverse cycle air conditioning, under-floor and ceiling insulation, solar power and automatic pool cover. Australian Cedar has been used throughout. With family living at its heart, the home features a large, open kitchen which flows into huge wrap around verandas, providing a seamless flow between indoor and outdoor living while offering magnificent views of the stunning surrounds. Manicured lawns, a long tarred driveway and guest parking give an elegance to the rural setting. Outdoors the 15 metre, tiled swimming pool lies within an aromatic scented garden of gardenias and jasmine, with spectacular views over the valley. Framed by a 10ft high bespoke wrought iron fence, the pool offers the perfect place to relax or entertain.  In keeping with the home\'s ethos of sustainable living, Coorabella features a home solar system, an orchard, vegetable garden, and two 38,000 litre rainwater tanks (with a spring feed dam, and a pump house with the ability to provide an endless supply of water to the property when needed.) The property also includes farm machinery sheds and ample storage.  The original dairy bales can also be used as self-contained creative studios.  The property is luxurious and sophisticated. The pool and house are both sought after locations for film and photo shoots for many well-known magazines and commercials. It is also highly in demand as a destination wedding location. It hosted the 2016 nuptials of A-list actress and producer Margot Robbie (""I, Tonya, Wolf of Wall Street) and Jacinta Barrett married her beau Gabriel Macht there (Jacinta acted with Meghan Markles in the long running series ""Suits"" and was a part of the inner circle invited to the recent Prince Harry wedding). This property is an expansive, majestic beauty. If you have a desire for a lifestyle that is both abundant in natural beauty and relaxation, while at the same time being only fifteen minutes away from all the entertainment and delights of Byron Bay and the beautiful North Coast beaches, you should not hesitate to inspect Coorabella.  The property will make a unique hinterland estate, an incredible family home. It is a piece of history which has been lovingly nurtured for over half a century, and is now ready for a new custodian. Conveniently located approximately 15 minutes to Byron Bay\'s beautiful beaches, 10mins to the villages of Bangalow and Mullumbimby, approximately 15 minutes to the seaside village of Brunswick Heads.
